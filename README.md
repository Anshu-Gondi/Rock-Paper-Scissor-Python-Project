# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using Python and Tkinter, with images representing the player's and computer's choices. The game also displays the result (win, lose, or draw) after each round.

## Features
- Player vs Computer gameplay with a graphical user interface.
- Displays images for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- Shows the result of each round.
- Clear button to reset the game.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Tkinter**: Tkinter is typically included with Python, but if itâ€™s missing, you can install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install tk
  ```
- **Pillow**: Used to manage and display images in Tkinter.
  ```bash
  pip install pillow
  ```
## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anshu-Gondi/Rock-Paper-Scissor-Python-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Rock-Paper-Scissor-Python-Project
   ```

3. Run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python Rock paper scissors game.py
   ```

4. The game window will open. Click the "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissor" buttons to play against the computer. Click   "CLEAR" to reset the game.

## Code Explanation

- **Canvas and Labels**: Tkinter's `Canvas` widget is used to display images and results.
- **Images**: Different images are loaded for Rock, Paper, and Scissors for both the player and computer.
- **Game Logic**: A simple `game()` function determines the result based on the player's and computer's choices.
- **Buttons**: Buttons allow the player to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and a "CLEAR" button resets the game.
